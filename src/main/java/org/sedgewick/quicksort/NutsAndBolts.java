 * Nuts and bolts.
 * A disorganized carpenter has a mixed pile of N nuts and N bolts.
 * The goal is to find the corresponding pairs of nuts and bolts.
 * Each nut fits exactly one bolt and each bolt fits exactly one nut.
 * By fitting a nut and a bolt together, the carpenter can see which one is bigger (but the carpenter cannot compare two nuts or two bolts directly).
 * Design an algorithm for the problem that uses NlogN compares (probabilistically).
