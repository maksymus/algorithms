 * Clone a linked structure with two pointers per node. Suppose that you are given a reference to the first node
 * of a linked structure where each node has two pointers: one pointer to the next node in the
 * sequence (as in a standard singly-linked list) and one pointer to an arbitrary node.
 *
 *  private class Node {
 *      private String item;
 *      private Node next;
 *      private Node random;
 *  }
 *
 * Design a linear-time algorithm to create a copy of the doubly-linked structure. You may modify the original linked
 * structure, but you must end up with two copies of the original.
