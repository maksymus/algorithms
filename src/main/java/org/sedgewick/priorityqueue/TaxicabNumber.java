/**
 * A taxicab number is an integer that can be expressed as the sum of two cubes of integers in two different ways: a^^3+b^^3=c^^3+d^^3.
 * For example, 172^^9=9^^3+10^^3=1^^3+12^^3. Design an algorithm to find all taxicab numbers with a, b, c, and d less than N.
 *    Version 1: Use time proportional to N^^2*logN and space proportional to N^^2.
 *    Version 2: Use time proportional to N^^2*logN and space proportional to N.
