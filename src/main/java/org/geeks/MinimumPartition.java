/**
 * Given a set of integers, the task is to divide it into two sets S1 and S2 such that the absolute difference between 
 * their sums is minimum.
 * 
 * If there is a set S with n elements, then if we assume Subset1 has m elements, Subset2 must have n-m elements and 
 * the value of abs(sum(Subset1) â€“ sum(Subset2)) should be minimum.
 * 
 * Example:
 *  Input:  arr[] = {1, 6, 11, 5} 
 *  Output: 1
 * Explanation:
 *  Subset1 = {1, 5, 6}, sum of Subset1 = 12 
 *  Subset2 = {11}, sum of Subset2 = 11
